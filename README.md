![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/hhhxiao/trapdoor-ll/total?style=for-the-badge)![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/hhhxiao/trapdoor-ll?style=for-the-badge)

This is the [LiteLoaderBDS](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderBDS)  Version
of [TrapDoor](https://github.com/hhhxiao/TrapDoor) for Minecraft Bedrock Version 1.19+.

Trapdoor is a minecraft bedrock server-side mod(or plugin) inspired by the java edition's carpet mod. It provides a
wealth of functions for survival and technical players, including but not limited to below:

- Change world ticking speed
- Display village bounds, center, iron golem spawn area, POI list and so on
- Measure and profile game MSPT and TPS
- Powerful fake player support
- ...

What's more, this mod **completely follows features of vanilla game**. This means it will **NOT** change any features
without notifying users and will **NOT** affect the game quality, so it is suitable for using this mod in vanilla
survival BDS.
